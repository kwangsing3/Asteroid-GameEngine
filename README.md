It's for learning how to make my own game engine, recently work on cmake branch.

## Why Asteroid?
  Every single games, they all made for their goal, for funny or for challenge, the similar type of game will close to each other.
so I descripted the game just like an asteroid, when the games made by Asteroid-GameEngine become more and more, 
they will become together and surround to the same goal (Planet), just like an asteroid belt.
After that, when we look back the Asteroid-GameEngine history, that will be attractive and wonderful universe landscape.
